# Underwater Image Enhancement
Assuming we are given an image taken under water, this repository provides algorithms to enhance that image. The whole implementation is based on the paper "Color Balance and Fusion for Underwater Image Enhancement".

# Introduction
The quality of the images taken under water may degrade due to factors such as medium scattering. This degradation may cause the image to have low contrast or to contain a layer of fog.
